            Paragraphs & Topic Sentences A paragraph is a series of sentences
            that are organized and coherent, and are all related to a single
            topic. Almost every piece of writing you do that is longer than a
            few sentences should be organized into paragraphs. This is because
            paragraphs show a reader where the subdivisions of an essay begin
            and end, and thus help the reader see the organization of the
            essay and grasp its main points. Paragraphs can contain many
            different kinds of information. A paragraph could contain a series
            of brief examples or a single long illustration of a general
            point. It might describe a place, character, or process; narrate a
            series of events; compare or contrast two or more things; classify
            items into categories; or describe causes and effects. Regardless
            of the kind of information they contain, all paragraphs share
            certain characteristics. One of the most important of these is a
            topic sentence.
